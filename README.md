# ðŸš² Bike Sharing Demand Prediction with AutoGluon

This project is part of the **AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals** specialization. It focuses on predicting bike-sharing demand using machine learning models built with **AutoGluon** on Amazon SageMaker Studio. The project is based on a Kaggle competition and demonstrates practical skills in tabular data modeling and cloud-based ML workflows.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

In this project, we tackle the **Bike Sharing Demand** prediction task, where the goal is to predict the number of rental bikes for a given hour based on historical and contextual data (e.g., weather, season, time of day).

This task simulates real-world business problems in companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDashâ€”where forecasting demand can significantly impact operational planning and customer satisfaction.

We use **AutoGluon Tabular Prediction** to:
- Preprocess and analyze CSV-based datasets
- Automatically train and optimize several ML models
- Generate and submit predictions to the Kaggle competition
- Evaluate model performance and iterate for improvement

## ðŸš€ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/)
- AWS SageMaker Studio
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Kaggle API (optional, for submission)
